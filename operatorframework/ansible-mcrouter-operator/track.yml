title: Mcrouter Operator powered by Ansible Operator
description: |
  The Mcrouter Operator was built with the [Ansible Operator SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/ansible/user-guide.md). It is not yet intended for production use.

  [Mcrouter](https://github.com/facebook/mcrouter) is a Memcached protocol router for scaling [Memcached](http://memcached.org/) deployments. It's a core component of cache infrastructure at Facebook and Instagram where mcrouter handles almost 5 billion requests per second at peak.

  Mcrouter features:

  * Memcached ASCII protocol
  * Connection pooling
  * Multiple hashing schemes
  * Prefix routing
  * Replicated pools
  * Production traffic shadowing
  * Online reconfiguration
  * Flexible routing

  Mcrouter is developed and maintained by Facebook.



  At this point in our training, we should have a basic understanding of the *Operator pattern*.
   - Ansible Operator is an Operator which is _powered by Ansible_.
   - Custom Resource events trigger Ansible tasks as opposed to the traditional approach of handling these events with Go code.
