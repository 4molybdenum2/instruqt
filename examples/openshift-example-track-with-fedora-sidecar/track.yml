  ## OpenShift example track

  OpenShift is a family of containerization software products developed by Red Hat.

  Its flagship product is the OpenShift Container Platform â€” an on-premises platform as a service built around Linux containers orchestrated and managed by Kubernetes on a foundation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

  The family's other products provide this platform through different environments:

  * OKD serves as the community-driven upstream (akin to the way that Fedora is upstream of Red Hat Enterprise Linux)
  * Developer Sandbox for OpenShift is the platform offered as software as a service, and OpenShift Dedicated is the platform offered as a managed service.

    Let's begin by connecting to OpenShift.

    From *Terminal 1*, run the following command to login with the OpenShift CLI:

    ```
    oc login -u admin -p admin https://api.crc.testing:6443 --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true
    ```

    You should see:
    ```bash
    Login successful.
    You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running `oc new-project <projectname>`
    ```
    Congratulations, you are now authenticated to the OpenShift cluster.

    Access the OpenShift Web Console to login from the Web UI:
    ```
    oc get routes console -n openshift-console -o jsonpath='{"https://"}{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
    ```
    Copy the URL from the output of the above command and open it in your browser.
    We'll deploy our app as the `admin` user. Use the following credentials:
    * Username:
    ```
    admin
    ```
    * Password:
    ```
    admin
    ```
