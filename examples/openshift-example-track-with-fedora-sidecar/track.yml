  ## OpenShift example track

  OpenShift is a family of containerization software products developed by Red Hat.

  Its flagship product is the OpenShift Container Platform â€” an on-premises platform as a service built around Linux containers orchestrated and managed by Kubernetes on a foundation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

  The family's other products provide this platform through different environments:

  * OKD serves as the community-driven upstream (akin to the way that Fedora is upstream of Red Hat Enterprise Linux)
  * Developer Sandbox for OpenShift is the platform offered as software as a service, and OpenShift Dedicated is the platform offered as a managed service.
