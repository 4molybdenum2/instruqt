  ### Unifies Imperative and Reactive

  Application requirements have changed drastically over the last few years. For any application to succeed in the era of cloud computing, big data or IoT, going reactive is increasingly becoming the architecture style to follow.

  Quarkus combines both the familiar imperative code and the non-blocking reactive style when developing applications.

  Quarkus uses Vert.x and Netty at its core. And uses a bunch of reactive frameworks and extensions on top to enable the developers. Quarkus is not just for HTTP microservices, but also for Event-Driven Architecture. The secret behind this is to use a single reactive engine for both imperative and reactive code.

  ![Reactive](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/quarkus/reactive-quarkus.png)

  Quarkus does this quite brilliantly. Between imperative and reactive the obvious choice is to have a reactive core. What that helps with is a fast non-blocking core that handles almost everything going via the event-loop. So if you were creating a typical REST application or a client-side application, Quarkus also gives you the imperative programming model. For example, Quarkus HTTP support is based on a non-blocking and reactive engine (Eclipse Vert.x and Netty). All the HTTP requests your application receive are handled by event loops (IO Thread) and then are routed towards the code that manages the request. Depending on the destination, it can invoke the code managing the request on a worker thread (Servlet, Jax-RS) or use the IO Thread (reactive route)

  In this scenario you will create a simple `Coffee Resource` endpoint by using JAX-RS with Quarkus backed by the Reactive SQL drivers; In our example we will use PostgreSQL Reactive SQL Driver. We will add methods like list, add and remove items from our list of famous Coffee.


  # Reactive SQL
  In every architecture component data is a key ingredient. With no surprises,relational databases store and crunch major amounts of data for applications to be used. Historically, traditional databases have not been reactive, that also trickles down to the JDBC API since using those databases have to be in conjuction with the underlying architecture, which ensures consistency, transactions, ACID etc. However in recent years, improvements have been made and JDBC access can now be done reactivels.

  Some of the advantages with reactive SQL with Quarkus are:
  - Simple API focusing on scalability and low overhead.
  - Reactive and non blocking which able to handle many database connections with a single thread.
  - Ranked #1 in the [TechEmpower Benchmark Round 15 Single query benchmark](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r15&hw=ph&test=db)

    # Inspect Java runtime

    An appropriate Java runtime has been installed for you. Ensure you can use it by running this command in Terminal 1:

    > If the command fails, wait a few moments and try again (it is installed in a background process and make take a few moments depending on system load).

    ```
    $JAVA_HOME/bin/java --version
    ```

    The command in Terminal 1 should report the version in use, for example (the versions and dates may be slightly different than the below example):

    ```console
    openjdk 11 2018-09-25
    OpenJDK Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11+28)
    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11+28, mixed mode)
    ```

    ## Import the code

    Let's refresh the code we'll be using. Run the following command to clone the sample project:

    ```
    cd /root/projects && rm -rf rhoar-getting-started && git clone https://github.com/openshift-katacoda/rhoar-getting-started
    ```

    # The Project

    You start with a basic Maven-based application with the usual `pom.xml` entries for a Quarkus app.

    We've also included a frontend HTML file at `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/index.html` that will show our list of Coffee.

    # The Application You Will Build

    The application is a simple CRUD app with a Front end that lists Coffee and gives options to remove and add more Coffee.

    We also use a CoffeeResource that helps us define those methods with JAX-RS.

    Further more we use a PostgreSQL database, where we create the databses, read from and write to it.

    Lets get started. We have already created a project for you, and let's continue adding functionality to this bare bones project.

    > In this guide, we will use the Mutiny API of the Reactive PostgreSQL Client. If you’re not familiar with Mutiny reactive types, read the [Getting Started with Reactive guide](https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started-reactive#mutiny) if you want to learn more!


    ## Add Extension

    Like other exercises, we’ll need another extension to start using the PosgtreSQL. Lets install it by runing on the following command:

    ```
    mvn quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="reactive-pg-client" -f /root/projects/rhoar-getting-started/quarkus/reactive-sql
    ```

    > The first time you add the extension, new dependencies may be downloaded via maven. This should only happen once, after that things will go even faster.

    This will add the necessary entries in your `pom.xml` to bring in the Reactive PostgreSQL extension. You'll see:

    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
        <artifactId>quarkus-reactive-pg-client</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ```

    There are a few other extensions we'll use that are already there, including `resteasy-jackson` (for encoding Java objects as JSON objects).

    With the app initialized, let's start coding!

    # Remote Live Coding

    What if you want to expand the inner loop development cycle to a remote container environment such as Kubernetes or OpenShift? You can configure your application in remote development mode to make changes to your local files immediately visible in your remote container environment. This allows you to develop in the same environment you will actually run your app in, and with access to the same services.

    We'll deploy our application to OpenShift and connect it to your local environment. The end result will be a fully functional app, already running on the target platform (OpenShift).

    ## Open the OpenShift Web Console

    OpenShift ships with a web-based console that will allow users to perform various tasks via a browser.

    Click on `OpenShift Web Console` tab then, login using the following credentials from the Web using.

    *Note* that you might see *Your connection is not private* notification due to using an untrusted security certificate. Then, proceed to access the OpenShift web console via clicking *Advanced* option.

    * Username:
    ```
    developer
    ```

    * Password:
    ```
    developer
    ```

    ![Web Console Login](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/quarkus/login.png)

    Run **Skip Tour** to skip the new user introduction.

    Run the following command to login with the OpenShift CLI:

    ```
    oc login -u developer -p developer
    ```

    You should see

    ```bash
    Login successful.

    You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

        oc new-project <projectname>
    ```

    ## Access OpenShift Project

    For this scenario, let's create a project that you will use to house your applications. Run:

    ```
    oc new-project reactive-sql --display-name="ReactiveSQL with Quarkus"
    ```

    **3. Open the OpenShift Web Console**

    Open the *reactive-sql* project from OpenShift Web Console.

    ![Web Console Login](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/quarkus/landing.png)

    There's nothing there now ("No workloads found"), but that's about to change.

    ## Deploy Postgres

    Our app will need a Postgres database. Run the next command to quickly deploy a Postgres instance to your new project:

    ```
    oc new-app \
        -e POSTGRESQL_USER=username \
        -e POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=password \
        -e POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=sampledb \
        --name=database \
        -l app.openshift.io/runtime=postgresql \
        openshift/postgresql
    ```

    You'll see the Postgres pod spinning up from the Topology View in the Web Console.

    ![Postgres pod](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/quarkus/rxpost.png)

    ## Add Quarkus OpenShift extension

    Quarkus offers the ability to automatically generate OpenShift resources based on sane defaults and user supplied configuration. The OpenShift extension is actually a wrapper extension that brings together the [kubernetes](https://quarkus.io/guides/deploying-to-kubernetes) and [container-image-s2i](https://quarkus.io/guides/container-image#s2i) extensions with defaults so that it’s easier for the user to get started with Quarkus on OpenShift.

    Run the following command to add it to our project:

    ```
    mvn quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="openshift" -f /root/projects/rhoar-getting-started/quarkus/reactive-sql
    ```

    You will see:

    ```console
    [SUCCESS] ✅ Extension io.quarkus:quarkus-openshift has been installed
    ```

    ## Configure Quarkus for remote live coding

    From the **Visual Editor** Tab, open `src/main/resources/application.properties`. This file contains Quarkus configuration.

    Add the following values to the `application.properties` file:

    ```text
    # Remote Live Coding setup
    quarkus.package.type=mutable-jar
    quarkus.live-reload.password=changeit

    # OpenShift Production Configuration
    quarkus.datasource.db-kind=postgresql
    quarkus.datasource.reactive.url=postgresql://database:5432/sampledb
    quarkus.datasource.username=username
    quarkus.datasource.password=password
    ```

    The `quarkus.package.type=mutable-jar` instructs Quarkus to package the app as a _mutable_ app. Mutable applications also include the deployment time parts of Quarkus (need for dev mode), so they take up a bit more disk space. If run normally they start just as fast and use the same memory as an immutable application, however they can also be started in dev mode.

    We also configure Quarkus to use the Postgres database, using `database` as the hostname (which is resolved by OpenShift to the running Postgres database host).

    > **NOTE:** that you can change the remote live-reload password to whatever you want. It is used to secure communication between the remote side and the local side.

    Click on the `Disk` icon to save the files or press `CTRL-S`:

    ![Visual Editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/quarkus/save-prop-file.png)

    ## Deploy application to OpenShift

    Run the following command which will build and deploy the Quarkus app in Openshift. There's a number of arguments (which could optionally be put in `application.properties`) that are explained below.

    ```
    mvn clean package -DskipTests -f /root/projects/rhoar-getting-started/quarkus/reactive-sql \
    -Dquarkus.kubernetes.deploy=true \
    -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true \
    -Dquarkus.kubernetes-client.trust-certs=true \
    -Dquarkus.kubernetes.deployment-target=openshift \
    -Dquarkus.openshift.route.expose=true \
    -Dquarkus.openshift.annotations.\"app.openshift.io/connects-to\"=database \
    -Dquarkus.openshift.env.vars.QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_DEVSERVICES=false \
    -Dquarkus.openshift.env.vars.quarkus-launch-devmode=true
    ```

    The output should end with `BUILD SUCCESS`.

    For more details of the above options:

    * `quarkus.kubernetes.deploy=true` - Instructs the extension to deploy to OpenShift after the container image is built
    * `quarkus.container-image.build=true` - Instructs the extension to build a container image
    * `quarkus.kubernetes-client.trust-certs=true` - We are using self-signed certs in this simple example, so this simply says to the extension to trust them.
    * `quarkus.kubernetes.deployment-target=openshift` - Instructs the extension to generate and create the OpenShift resources (like `DeploymentConfig`s and `Service`s) after building the container
    * `quarkus.openshift.route.expose=true` - Instructs the extension to generate an OpenShift `Route` so we can access it from our browser.
    * `quarkus.kubernetes.annotations."app.openshift.io/connects-to"=database` - Adds a visual connector to show the DB connection in the web console topology view.
    * `quarkus.openshift.env.vars.QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_DEVSERVICES=false` - Disables Quarkus dev services, as these are not needed on OpenShift
    * `quarkus.openshift.env.vars.quarkus-launch-devmode=true` - Sets an environment variable in the container to tell Quarkus to launch in dev mode (not production mode which is the default when deploying to Kubernetes or OpenShift)

    Finally, make sure it's actually done rolling out:

    ```
    oc rollout status -w dc/reactive-sql
    ```

    Wait (about 30 seconds) for that command to report `replication controller "reactive-sql-1" successfully rolled out` before continuing.

    > If the `oc rollout` command appears to not finish, just `CTRL-C` it and run it again.

    You can see it running in the OpenShift Console.

    ![Quarkus pod](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/quarkus/rx-deploy.png)

    Do a quick test to ensure the remote app is running by running to the app's Route from the Topology view.

    To get the URL from command line, from *Terminal 1* run this command to get the app's Route:

    ```
    export APP_ROUTE=`oc get route reactive-sql -n reactive-sql -o jsonpath='{"http://"}{.spec.host}'`
    echo $APP_ROUTE
    ```

    > It may take a few seconds for the app to work and the networking to get glued together, so if it doesn't show up, just reload the browser until it does.

    You should see:

    ![Web Console Login](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/quarkus/rx-initial.png)

    It's working! We'll leave it running and use Quarkus' Remote Live Reload feature to automatically update our app as we make changes.

    # Remote Dev Connection

    Now we are ready to run our in dev mode and connect it to the remote application. Run here to run:

    ```
    mvn quarkus:remote-dev -Dquarkus.live-reload.url=$APP_ROUTE -f /root/projects/rhoar-getting-started/quarkus/reactive-sql
    ```

    You should see a bunch of log output including:

    ```console
    INFO  [io.qua.ver.htt.dep.dev.HttpRemoteDevClient] (Remote dev client thread) Connected to remote server
    ```

    Your locally running Quarkus app is now connected to the remote side running on OpenShift, and changes you make here will be immediately reflected live in the remote application. Cool!

    Let's change the `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/ndex.html`. Add ` - Remote Dev` to the banner text:

    ![Visual Editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/quarkus/remote-dev-index.png)

    Save the file then refresh your web browser. You will see that the index page on OpenShift is updated automatically:

    ![Visual Editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/quarkus/reload-index.png)

    # Congratulations!

    You've seen how to setup a remote connection to live code your application as it runs in the target environment (in this case OpenShift)

    In the next step we'll add more functionality to the app using the Reactive SQL clients for Quarkus.

  assignment: |-
    In the previous step you created created a PostgreSQL databases for your app, and also added the extensions. In this section we will create our Reactive CoffeeResource and its endpoints.

    ## Add CoffeeResource endpoints

    Let’s modify the application and add relevant methods. The CoffeeResource has alredy been created we will add the functionality to it.
    From the **Visual Editor** Tab, open this file : `src/main/java/org/acme/reactive/CoffeeResource.java`.

    **1. Add db initialization**
    Lets add a few queries to initialize our database. We could have also choosen to omit this step, in that case the database should have had these tables. But since we have a new barebones instance, we can also use this way of initializing.

    Add this content after the `// TODO initdb` comment:

    ```java
            client.query("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS coffee").execute()
                    .flatMap(r -> client.query("CREATE TABLE coffee (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL)").execute())
                    .flatMap(r -> client.query("INSERT INTO coffee (name) VALUES ('Americano')").execute())
                    .flatMap(r -> client.query("INSERT INTO coffee (name) VALUES ('Latte')").execute())
                    .flatMap(r -> client.query("INSERT INTO coffee (name) VALUES ('Mocha')").execute()).await()
                    .indefinitely();
    ```

    **2. Add REST methods**

    First let's add our GET method so we can get the list of all the Coffee, and also if we want to look up with id where we add the `PathParam` to our method and with `@Path` annotation to enable the request to our `getSingle` method.

    Add this content after the `// TODO GET` comment:

    ```java
        @GET
        public Multi<Coffee> get() {
            return Coffee.findAll(client);
        }

        @GET
        @Path("{id}")
        public Uni<Response> getSingle(@PathParam("id") Long id) {
            return Coffee.findById(client, id)
                .onItem().transform(fruit -> fruit != null ? Response.ok(fruit) : Response.status(Status.NOT_FOUND))
                .onItem().transform(ResponseBuilder::build);
        }

    ```
    Next let's add the POST and PUT request methods.

    Add this content after the `// TODO POST` comment:

    ```java

        @POST
        public Uni<Response> create(Coffee coffee) {
            return coffee.save(client)
                    .onItem().transform(id -> URI.create("/coffee/" + id))
                    .onItem().transform(uri -> Response.created(uri).build());
        }

        @PUT
        @Path("{id}")
        public Uni<Response> update(@PathParam("id") Long id, Coffee coffee) {
            return coffee.update(client)
                .onItem().transform(updated -> updated ? Status.OK : Status.NOT_FOUND)
                .onItem().transform(status -> Response.status(status).build());
        }

    ```

    Finally let's add the DELETE method, so we can also delete Coffee from our quarkus app.

    Add this content after the `// TODO DELETE` comment:

    ```java
        @DELETE
        @Path("{id}")
        public Uni<Response> delete(@PathParam("id") Long id) {
            return Coffee.delete(client, id)
                    .onItem().transform(deleted -> deleted ? Status.NO_CONTENT : Status.NOT_FOUND)
                    .onItem().transform(status -> Response.status(status).build());
        }
    ```

    Click on the `Disk` icon to save the files or press `CTRL-S`:

    ![Visual Editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/quarkus/save-coffee-file.png)

    Let's continue further to add reactive accessor methods for our Coffee resource.

  assignment: |-
    Let's continue in this section and define are model Class

    Let’s modify the application and add relevant methods. The `Coffee` model class has alredy been created we will add the functionality to it.
    From the **Visual Editor** Tab, open this file: `src/main/java/org/acme/reactive/Coffee.java`.

    We only have two fields, one for the ID of the Coffe and one for its name.
    ```java

        public Long id;

        public String name;

    ```

    With this simple model we implement some of the accessor methods. e.g save, from, update etc. All of them use a `PgPool` object, since we are going to use a PostgreSQL database and are using the PostgreSQL reactive driver.

    Lets add the `findById` method.

    **1. Add FindById method**

    Add this content after the `// TODO FindById` comment:

    ```java
        public static Uni<Coffee> findById(PgPool client, Long id) {
            return client.preparedQuery("SELECT id, name FROM coffee WHERE id = $1").execute(Tuple.of(id))
                    .onItem().transform(RowSet::iterator)
                    .onItem().transform(iterator -> iterator.hasNext() ? from(iterator.next()) : null);
        }
    ```

    In the above you can see we use a `PgPool` object and once the query is prepared we then apply successive `onItem` reactive methods to transform the result and finally passing that back as a `Uni<Coffee>`, part of the Mutiny reactive API.

    Save the file.

    ## Inspect the results

    Go back to your browser then reload it. You will see Coffee elements to the list.

    ![File](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/quarkus/new-index.png)

    ## Congratulations!

    Now you have a running app, with a reactive database extension.
    In the next step, we'll redeploy it to OpenShift.

    In the previous step you added a custom bean to the app. Let's now package it up as a production app and deploy it.

    ## Deploy production application to OpenShift

    To deploy the application "in production", we can simply re-deploy the application using the OpenShift extension, omitting the `quarkus-launch-devmode` environment variable. Run the following command to do this:

    ```bash
    cd /root/projects/rhoar-getting-started/quarkus/reactive-sql && \
      mvn clean package -DskipTests \
      -Dquarkus.kubernetes.deploy=true \
      -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true \
      -Dquarkus.kubernetes-client.trust-certs=true \
      -Dquarkus.kubernetes.deployment-target=openshift \
      -Dquarkus.openshift.route.expose=true \
      -Dquarkus.openshift.annotations.\"app.openshift.io/connects-to\"=database
    ```

    Finally, make sure it's actually done rolling out:

    ```
    oc rollout status -w dc/reactive-sql
    ```

    Wait (about 30 seconds) for that command to report `replication controller "reactive-sql-3" successfully rolled out` before continuing.

    > If the `oc rollout` command appears to not finish, just `CTRL-C` it and run it again.

    The output should end with `BUILD SUCCESS`.

    To get the URL from command line, from *Terminal 1* run this command to get the app's Route:

    ```
    oc get route reactive-sql -n reactive-sql -o jsonpath='{"http://"}{.spec.host}'
    ```

    Copy the URL from the output of the above command and open it in your browser.
