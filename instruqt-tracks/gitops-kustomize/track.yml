title: Working with Kustomize
description: |
  ## Goal

  This guide helps you get familiar with how to use Kustomize with Argo CD on OpenShift.


  ## Concepts

  [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) traverses a Kubernetes manifest to add, remove or update configuration options without forking. It is available both as a standalone binary and as a native feature of `kubectl` (and by extension `oc`).

  The principals of `kustomize` are:

  * Purely declarative approach to configuration customization
  * Manage an arbitrary number of distinctly customized Kubernetes configurations
  * Every artifact that kustomize uses is plain YAML and can be validated and processed as such
  * As a "templateless" templating system; it encourages using YAML without forking the repo it.
