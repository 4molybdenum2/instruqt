  ## Goal

  This scenario will get you get familiar with syncwaves and hook phases.


  ## Concepts

  [Syncwaves](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/sync-waves/)
  are used in Argo CD to order how manifests
  are applied to the cluster. Whereas [resource hooks](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/resource_hooks/)
  breaks up the delivery of these manifests in different phases.

  [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/) is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.

  Using a combination of syncwaves and resource hooks, you can control how your application rolls out.

  ## Use case

  This is a simple guide that takes you through the following steps:

  * Using Syncwaves to order deployment
  * Exploring Resource Hooks
  * Using Syncwaves and Hooks together

  This OpenShift cluster will self-destruct in one hour.
