title: Reactive Streaming with Quarkus and Kafka
description: |-
  In this track, you will use the Quarkus Kafka extension to build a streaming application using MicroProfile Reactive
  Streams Messaging and [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org), a distributed streaming platform.

  |What you need to know before you start|
  |----|
  |In order to get full benefit from taking this track you should...<br>• Have experience programming applications in Java using the [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) framework.<br>• Have familiarity with using [Java annotations](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/type-annotations/). <br>• Have some introductory experience creating Java/Maven applications using Quarkus. <br>• Understand the basics of creating [event driven applications](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration/what-is-event-driven-architecture) using message streams and message brokers, such as [Kafka](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration/what-is-apache-kafka). <br>• Understand the [fundamentals of Kubernetes](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/what-is-kubernetes) in general and [Kubernetes operators](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/kubernetes-operators) in particular.|

  ## What is Apache Kafka?

  Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform. A streaming platform has three key capabilities:

    - Publish and subscribe to streams of records, similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system.
    - Store streams of records in a fault-tolerant durable way.
    - Process streams of records as they occur.

  Kafka is generally used for two broad classes of applications:

    - Building real-time streaming data pipelines that reliably get data between systems or applications
    - Building real-time streaming applications that transform or react to the streams of data
